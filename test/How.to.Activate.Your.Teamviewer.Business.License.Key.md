You can also access and control devices across different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and ChromeOS.
 
A Teamviewer Business license key also gives you access to advanced features such as VPN, remote printing, remote sound, black screen, wake-on-LAN, proxy support, multiple monitor support, file transfer, VoIP, video, chat, switch sides, custom branding, and in-session automation/scripting.
 
A Teamviewer Business license key is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. You can also upgrade your license to a higher plan if you need more features or connections.
